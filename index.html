            <p>"Salvador (Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation: [sawvaˈdoʁ]) is a Brazilian municipality and 
            capital city of the state of Bahia. Situated in the Zona da Mata in the Northeast Region of 
            Brazil, Salvador is recognized throughout the country and internationally for its cuisine, 
            music, and architecture. The African influence in many cultural aspects of the city makes it
             a center of Afro-Brazilian culture. As the first capital of Colonial Brazil, the city is one
              of the oldest in the Americas. Its foundation in 1549 by Tomé de Sousa took place on account
               of the implementation of the General Government of Brazil by the Portuguese Empire." - wiki</p>
